# Tree Sitter Parser for Lart Language

I'm implementing `rule 110` as source inside `hello.rs`, which extension is `.rs` instead of `.rf` because I'm lazy and rust syntax is similar to mine so that I can exploit Neovim syntax highlighting.

Some aspects remain unclear (such as variadic arguments) but the core language syntax which allow to build a `rule 110` is there (not implemented as compiler, though).
